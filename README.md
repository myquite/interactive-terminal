Goal: Build a Interactive Web-based Terminal Simulator to work through exercises and build confidence with basic command-line tools.

Current Commands:

- clear
- echo
- pwd
- ls
- cat
- help

- test (shows how the input in the terminal is being broken up into command, options, and arguments)
  Example: test -h -r "Hello World"

Live Project: [Interactive Terminal](https://myquite.github.io/interactive-terminal/)

## Priority Tasks

- Implement missing command handlers in terminalCommands.js
- Add file manipulation commands (touch, mkdir, rm)
- Add file content viewing/editing
- Add proper error handling
